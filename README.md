# TumblrDomainCheck
Shell script that periodically checks if a (set of) tumblr URL(s) are available or not. Ideally paired with Conky.

## How to use:
Modify the shell script with the URL(s) you want to monitor, modify the time if needed (this may trigger anti-bot behaviour, you've been warned. Default value is 3600 seconds or 1 hour) and run the script.

Requires the libnotify dependency for notifications.
